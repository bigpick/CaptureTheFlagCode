# Info

(Yet another) List of useful CTF tools. These are what I've found I come back to more often than the others in the giant lists of "all great CTF tools":
* [awesome-ctf](https://github.com/apsdehal/awesome-ctf)
* [ctf-tools](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools)
* [essential-ctf-tools (medium)](https://medium.com/@int0x33/day-18-essential-ctf-tools-1f9af1552214)

If you want direction on how/when to use the tools here, seriously, see the above repos (or Google). They've put in way more effort and will do the tools much more justice than I could.
