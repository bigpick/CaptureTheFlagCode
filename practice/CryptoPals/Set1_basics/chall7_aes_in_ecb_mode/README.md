# [AES in ECB mode](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/7)

The Base64-encoded content [in this file](https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/7.txt) has been encrypted via AES-128 in ECB mode under the key

```
"YELLOW SUBMARINE".
```

(case-sensitive, without the quotes; exactly 16 characters; I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because it's exactly 16 bytes long, and now you do too).

Decrypt it. You know the key, after all.

Easiest way: use OpenSSL::Cipher and give it AES-128-ECB as the cipher.

> Do this with code.
> You can obviously decrypt this using the OpenSSL command-line tool, but we're having you get ECB working in code for a reason. You'll need it a lot later on, and not just for attacking ECB.

```
./chall7.py chall7_data.txt
I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy.

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
â€¦
