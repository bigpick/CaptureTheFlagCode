These are not meant to illustrate _the_ solution to any of the challenges, but the proccess _I_ went through to try to get there.

I'm going to try to write these in parallel with solving them, as it will better serve my learning to do both at the same time, I think. Also, it would be a bit more realistic than doing all the work and trys/fails until finally getting the solution and then just pasting a cut and dry approach.

They may get quite verbose, as this is 100% new to me. I'll try to put a tl;dr section in each at the bottom to give a quick glance if you're not interested in my learning process when applicable.
